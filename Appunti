Single Page Applications (SPA):

SPAs allow for different views to be loaded into a shell page as the user interacts with that page. is a container
in witch we can load a view. Using js we can replace the view with another view.

SPA rely on different tech:
 - DOM manipulation
 - History
 - Routing
 - AJAX
 - Data Binding
 ...

Modules: are just containers that components that we build for our application, such as controllers, directives, services,
have a way to be organized in one little container.

Routes: A rout decide what view gets loaded, is actually a path that you'll see up in the URL of our browser.

A rout is going to have a view and a controller and the Scope, witch is in between will be the model.

The controller will get the data en bind them into the view using directives.

Directives:

ng-cloak: on a div will set the display to none, so it will hide it.
ng-model: Use the NgModel directive to display a data property and update that property when the user makes changes.
ng-switch: The ngSwitch directive on a container specifies an expression to match against. The expressions to match are provided by ngSwitchCase directives on views within the container.
ng-class: used to take data from scss classes
ng-repeat: iterate a collection

| : is used to add formatters, it's called a pipe, and for example if i add | currency i can see that the value will be formatted as a price

we can use limit to limit how much of a list we want to see, and order by to order a list.
